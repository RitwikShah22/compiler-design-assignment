## 📘 Grammar Derivation and Parse Tree – Overview

This document presents a **problem-solving exercise in Syntax Analysis**, focusing on
**grammar derivation and parse tree construction** as studied in **Principles of Compiler Design**.

The grammar consists of simple production rules involving non-terminals **S, A, and B**, with
recursive and ε-productions. The main objective is to demonstrate how a given **input string**
can be generated from the grammar using a **leftmost derivation**.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Analyze a context-free grammar  
- Perform **step-by-step leftmost derivation**  
- Understand the role of **ε (empty string) productions**  
- Visualize syntax structure using a **parse tree**  

---

## 🧩 What the Document Covers
- Definition of grammar rules  
- Detailed leftmost derivation to generate a target string  
- Explanation of how non-terminals expand during derivation  
- Conceptual description of the parse tree structure  
- A summary table showing derivation steps clearly  

---

## 🌳 Conceptual Understanding
The document explains how:
- Recursive rules generate repeated terminals  
- ε-productions terminate recursion  
- The parse tree represents hierarchical structure  
- Leaf nodes, read left-to-right, form the final string  

This strengthens understanding of **grammar rules**, **derivations**, and **syntax trees**.

## ✅ Academic Relevance
This work is useful for:
- Learning syntax analysis fundamentals  
- Practicing grammar-based problem solving  
- Preparing for exams and assignments in compiler design  
- Building intuition for parsing techniques
